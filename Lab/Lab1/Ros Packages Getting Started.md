---

## Before you start

- Use **Ubuntu + ROS 2** (native Linux or WSL2 on Windows).

- Open a **terminal** and keep it for the whole lab.

- In every new terminal, source your ROS 2 setup:

```bash
source /opt/ros/<distro>/setup.bash
```

> Replace `<distro>` with your ROS 2 distro (e.g., humble, iron, jazzy).

### Tips:
- Skip unattended installation in Virtual Box (if you want a minimal installation).
- Minimal installation contains fewer applications.
- Erasing the disk in Virtual Box is safe (in contrast to making a dual boot).
- Sometimes the Virtualization option is disabled on your PC. You should enable this from the BIOS.
- To have a full-screen Virtual Box experience:
  1. Insert the guest additions CD image.
  2. Run `./vbox additions` with administrator rights.
  3. Install required packages:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc make perl dkms
     ```

## Lab 2 — ROS 2 Basics

I'll help arrange this into a more organized format with proper bash code blocks for Jupiter notebook usage:

# ROS2 Packages

## Installing Colcon Package Builder

```bash
sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
```

For Colcon autocompletion (using tab key):
- Source the following in each new terminal or add it at the end of `~/.bashrc` file:
```bash
source /usr/share/colcon_argcomplete/hook/colcon-argcomplete.bash
```

#### Creating a Workspace (a main folder to manage ROS packages)
- It consists of the folder and a `src` subfolder, which will contain the packages:
```bash
mkdir ~/ros2_ws/
```

#### Create a `src` Folder Inside the Workspace (used by the Colcon builder)
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/
mkdir src
```

#### Building the Whole Workspace
- Run this command in the workspace folder (it will create `install` folders containing executables):
```bash
colcon build
```

#### Sourcing the Workspace `setup.bash` to Make the Workspace Functionalities Available in Terminals
- Add this to your `.bashrc`:
```bash
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
```

#### Creating a Python Package
1. Change directory to your `src` folder:
```bash
cd src
```

2. Use `ament` as the package creator, and `ament_python` for a Python package.
   - `colcon` will be the package builder.
   - Add dependencies (e.g., `rclpy`, the ROS client for Python to write ROS nodes in Python).

   **Note about Naming Packages:**
   - Package names should start with a lowercase letter and only contain lowercase letters, digits, underscores, and dashes.

3. Create the package:
```bash
ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python <package_name> --dependencies rclpy
```

#### Building a Single Package in the Workspace
- To build a specific package, use the following command with `colcon`:
```bash
colcon build --packages-select <package_name>
```


# ROS2 Nodes

![image.png](attachment:image.png)


# ROS2 Node Commands

Starting a node
```bash
ros2 run <package_name> <executable_name>
```

examples:
```bash
ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
```

list running nodes:
```bash
ros2 node list
```

check node information
```bash
ros2 node info <node_name>
```

Check nodes on RQT graph
```bash
rqt_graph
```


# Note about setuptools library
Sometimes (depending on your system, hardware etc.), when building with colcon, an error related to python3 library setuptools is showing
(ubuntu 22.04, Ros2 Humble), apparently version 59 of settup tools with ros humble, is causing the error.
to solve this you can downgrade to version 58 of setuptools

to list all python packages with their versions
```bash
pip3 list
```

to check the version of one package
```bash
pip3 list | grep packagename
```

for example
```bash
pip3 list | grep setuptools
```

to downgrade to a specific version
```bash
pip3 install packagename==version
```

for example
```bash
pip3 install setuptools==58
```


# Raw Ros2 node

not structured as a class


```bash
#raw ros2 python node (without a main funtion, or a class sturcture)
#this is the most basic form of using rclpy library

#importing ros2 clinet library for python
import rclpy
#also importing the Node class inside it (more practical)
from rclpy.node import Node

#start Ros communication
rclpy.init()

#define a node, give it a name (node constructor)
node = Node("pyNode1")

#output something with the node
node.get_logger().info("hello node")

#keeps the node spinning (keep your program running)
#rclpy.spin(node)


#shutdown ros communication
rclpy.shutdown()
```

## Adding A function:  main


```python
# python code, to execute lines only if the current script is run by itself (not called in another script)

#example of any function
def main():
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main() #calling the fucntion
```

# Structuring as a class


```python
# same example with main condition

class AUBLAB():
    def __init__(self):
        self.a = 10

    def SampleFunction(self, number):
        self.b = self.a +number


if __name__ == "__main__":
    
    MyLab = AUBLAB()
    MyLab.SampleFunction(10)
    print(MyLab.b)
```

# Constructing the class based on the rclpy Node class


```python
#python defining a class based on another one, and using super inside the init function, so the "self" object will represent this type of class
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node


#create a class passing the Node class as argument
class MyNode(Node):

    #node initiation function
    def __init__(self):
        #consturcting the node, self object will be representing the Node class
        super().__init__("pyNode1")
```

```python
#ROS2 node, written in python, displayed as a function that can be built

import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node

def main():
    #start Ros communication
    rclpy.init()

    #define a node, give it a name (node constructor)
    node = Node("pyNode1")

    #output something with the node
    node.get_logger().info("hello node")

    #keeps the node spinning (keep your program running)
    rclpy.spin(node)

    #shutdown ros communication
    rclpy.shutdown()
```

# Complete Ros2 Node structured as a class


```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

#RO2 node, written in python, written as a class consturcted with "Node" class from rclpy, and called from an external function that can be built.
#this is the recommended way or writing a ros2 node in python (scalable, modular, and most documentations online use this format)


import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node


#create a class passing the Node class as argument
class MyNode(Node):

    #node initiation function
    def __init__(self):
        #consturcting the node, it will be come the "self" object of the class
        super().__init__("pyNode2")
        
        #output
        self.get_logger().info("Hello from new node 2")



def main():
    #start Ros communication
    rclpy.init()

    #define a node, give it a name (node constructor)
    node = MyNode()

    #keeps the ros communication spinning (keep your program running)
    rclpy.spin(node)
    
    #destroy node (optional, to be cleared in the backround or it will be done by garbage collector
    node.destroy_node()
    
    #shutdown ros communication
    rclpy.shutdown()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```bash
# modify the setup.py file of the package to install/build the ros2 node (creates executables)

entry_points={
    'console_scripts': [
        "PyNode1exe = PakcageName.ScriptName:functionname",
        "PyNode2exe = PakcageName.ScriptName:functionname"
    ],
},
```

# Launching 2 instances of a same node

# Node Information and Naming

To check info about a node
```bash
ros2 node info /nodename
```

this will show info about publishers and subscribers too

you can launch two nodes with the same name in ros2
(you would get a warning in ros2 node list)

to change a node name at run time (use same node, multiple times with different names)
run the node with additional arguments:
- `--ros-args` means you are supplying an argument to the node
- `-r __node:=newnodename` is used to remap (supply the new name, as argument)

```bash
ros2 run packagename nodename --ros-args -r __node:=abc
```


# colcon notes

```bash
colcon build --packages-select packagename --symlink-install
```

(works only for python)
build the package in a way, that each time the code is changed and the executable is triggered, you don't need to rebuild (this is efficient when developing - for example when changing the name of the node)

also to work the python file must be an executable (allow to execute the python file as an OS program)
```bash
chmod +x pythonscriptname.py
```

when listing ls in terminal executables are colored in green
you can also right click the file, properties, permissions, and set it to execute

## Lab 3 — Publishers, Subscribers, Services

# Timers, Calback Functions


```bash
# using timer in ros2 nodes

#create a timer that calls a certain function, each number of seconds
self.timer = self.create_timer(2, self.callbackfunction)

#this will call the callbackfucntion each 2 seconds
```

```python
# the python local time function can also be used to make the program wait
import time

time.sleep(1) #waits for 1 second
```

# Ros2 Topics: publishers subscribers, to exchange messages

Topic:
- A named bus over which nodes exchange messages
- One topic can have multiple publishers - subscribers (each one of them is independant of the other)
- The message type must be specific, and it can be customized. The default "string" message with its "data" field can be used to start with

Practical Note:
as we have seen before, script name, node name, executable name are different. But sometimes, they could be the same.

To create a publisher inside a node
> node.create_publisher(String, "TopicName", 10)

10 is the default value of the queue size, which is the number of messages to keep in a buffer in case the application is late at handling the messages

To check available message type, the ros2 interface command can be used
> ros2 interface show <pakagename>/msg/<messagename>

the following string message can be used as a sample
> ros2 interface show example_interfaces/msg/String

the output is string data
type is string
field is data

to add this message type in our code we include a python import
> from example_interfaces.msg import String

we also add it as a package dependency, in the package.xml file
<depend>example_interfaces</depend>


```python
# we create a fucntion that will be used with this topic to publish
#this function will the the message type String that we included

def publishingfunction(self):

    #create a messge, of type string, and field data
    msg = String()
    msg.data = "Hello"
    self.publisher.publish(msg)
```

# Complete Publisher


```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

#COMPLETE PUBLISHER

import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node


#import the String message, from example_interfaces pakcage
from example_interfaces.msg import String


#create a class passing the Node class as argument
class MyNode(Node):

    #node initiation function
    def __init__(self):
        #consturcting the node, it will be come the "self" object of the class
        super().__init__("pyNode2")
        
        #create a publisher
        self.publisher_ = self.create_publisher(String, "InterestingTopic", 10)

        #create a timer to publish periodically
        self.timer = self.create_timer(1, self.pub)
        #output
        self.get_logger().info("Hello from this node")

        
    #create a function that handles the publishing
    def pub(self):
        #create a message
        msg = String()
        #fill the "data" field of this message
        msg.data = "Hi, this is a great message"

        #pulish the message with the publisher
        self.publisher_.publish(msg)
        self.get_logger().info("a new message has been published")
        self.get_logger().info(msg.data)
        #when you print , you print msg.data not msg
        #msg is the message object
        #msg.data is the message string field

def main():
    #start Ros communication
    rclpy.init()

    #define a node, give it a name (node constructor)
    node = MyNode()

    #keeps the ros communication spinning (keep your program running)
    rclpy.spin(node)
    
    #destroy node (optional, to be cleared in the backround or it will be done by garbage collector
    node.destroy_node()

    #shutdown ros communication
    rclpy.shutdown()


if __name__ == "__main__":

```python
# Subscriber node, create a subsciber node

#create a subsciber object
self.subscription = self.create_subscription(String,'topic',self.listener_callback,10)

#definde a callback function for the subsciber, this function, is called when a new message is recieved

# Debugging Topics
to check all available topics
> ros2 topic list

to print/simulate what is coming out of the topic
> ros2 topic echo /topicname

to check info on a topic
> ro2 topic info /topicname

/rosout is a hidden standard topic in ros2, when you log (print in ros2), messages are published on this topic
>/rosout

to show /rosout in rqt_graph you can remove debug and dead sinks markers

to check frequency rate of a topic in hz
> ros2 topic hz /topicname

to check the bandwidth (bits/sec)
> ros2 topic bw /topicname


# Rename a topic at runtime with remap

ros2 run <pakcagename> <executablename> --rs-args -r __node:newnodename -r oldtopicname:=newtopicname


# ROS2 Services
server, client
request, response

what are services

Services are another method of communication for nodes in the ROS graph. Services are based on a call-and-response model, versus topics’ publisher-subscriber model. While topics allow nodes to subscribe to data streams and get continual updates, services only provide data when they are specifically called by a client.

with topics we had to define the topic type (string etc.) it was called the interface a message (msg)

here we have to define the type for the request, and the response, (which could be different), the interface is called a Service

example_interfaces contain various service examples

ros2 interface show example_interfaces/srv/AddTwoInts

int64 a
int64 b
---
int64 sum

this will take two integers a and b
and retrun a third integer sum
a,b are part of the request
sum is part of the response


# Simple Server


```python
#Sample code for a simple server

import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node

    def add_two_ints_callback(self, request, response):

(you might use is when working with third party packages)

ros tool used check and install dependencies (usually) before building

for example <depend>rclpy</depend>
if rclpy was not installed, rosdep can install it

install rosdep
> sudo apt install python3-rosdep2

initialize rosdep (For the first time)
> sudo rosdep init

> rosdep update

use rosdep
run the command inside your main workspace folder (src is the folder containing your code)

> rosdep install --from-paths src -y --ignore-src


# a word about git, github

git is a version control system, to manage code versions and repositories

installation
> sudo apt install git

git has many commands (not part of this lab) we will be just looking into the cloning feature:
for cloning (downloading) on anline repository

> git clone onlinelink

this will copy files, from online repo to your current folder

gihub.com (not to be confused with git) is a website (like many onther simlar sites), for hosting, online repositories

for example, ROS2 have their own github page

> https://github.com/ros2

containing several repositories, one of them is for examples

> https://github.com/ros2/examples

to clone it locally, go to a desired location and use git

> git clone https://github.com/ros2/exmaples


# Ros2  launch
for scaling up ros applications
used to launch multiple nodes at once

add a /launch folder to your package

create launch files in your launch folder


```python
# examplelaunch.py
#use the following script for python launch library, copy paste and add needed nodes from different packages 
import launch
import launch_ros.actions

def generate_launch_description():
    return launch.LaunchDescription([
        launch_ros.actions.Node(
            package='demo_nodes_cpp',
            executable='talker',
            name='talker'
        ),
        launch_ros.actions.Node(
            package='demo_nodes_cpp',
            executable='listener',
            name='listener'
        )
